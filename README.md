    ***As i was trying to work on linux and i found this, just documenting might delete later:

Reset Git Configuration: If you suspect that Git configuration settings from Windows might be causing issues, you can reset them on Linux. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

    bash -command, below:

#just for info ,$git config --global --unset-all core.autocrlf
    *$git config --global core.autocrlf input
this is because of linux's different line ending
